          Engines make the <strong>tremendous power</strong> needed to propel the aircraft
          through the sky.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        The engines "breathe in" massive amounts of air, mix it with fuel, and
        then <strong>ignite it</strong>, creating a controlled explosion that releases an
        incredible amount of energy.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        The powerful explosion inside the engine creates a force that gets
        pushed out of the back of the engine at an <strong>extremely high speed</strong>. This
        force, also known as thrust, is what makes the plane zoom forward
        through the air.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        It's like blowing up a balloon and letting it go, but on a much larger
        and more controlled scale.
      </p>
