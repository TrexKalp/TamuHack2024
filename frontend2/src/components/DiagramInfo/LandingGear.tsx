        Landing gear are essentially the aircraft's <strong>legs</strong>.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        The landing gear comprises several elements, including robust 
        <strong> shock-absorbing</strong> struts and a set of wheels. When the
        plane is on the ground, the landing gear allows for smooth movement,
        almost <strong>like a car</strong>. However, as the plane ascends into
        the sky, the landing gear performs a remarkable feat - it{" "}
        <strong>retracts into the fuselage or wings</strong>, minimizing air
        resistance and optimizing the aerodynamics of the aircraft.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        During the process of landing, the landing gear{" "}
        <strong>extends once again</strong>. As the aircraft descends and makes
        contact with the runway, the wheels and struts actively absorb the
        forces involved in landing, ensuring a gradual and controlled touchdown.
